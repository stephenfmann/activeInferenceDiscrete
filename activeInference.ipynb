The paper is really great, but it's pretty difficult at points, so to help me understand the passages clearly I thought of taking notes and organizing them here.

    "\n",
    "- $s_\\tau$: a one-hot vector modelling the state at time $\\tau$. The vector is 1 on the index of the state. The number of components is $m$.\n",
    "- $o_\\tau$: like $s_\\tau$, but for observations. Number of components is $n$.\n",
    "- $\\pi$ is a policy, which is just a vector whose $i^{th}$ element, $\\pi_i$, contains the action to be performed at timestep $i$.\n",
    "- $A$: A likelihood matrix with shape $n \\times m$. This is used in the generative model to model how states generate observations. Each column corresponds to a state, and each row to an observation. Each column is a probability vector over observations, describing the probabilities that the state corresponding to the column would produce each row/observation. $o_\\tau^T A$ is the vector of the probabilities of $o_\\tau$ being generated by each state. $A s_\\tau$ is the vector with the probability of each observation given state $s_\\tau$. $o_\\tau^T A s_\\tau$ is the probability that state $s_\\tau$ would generate observation $o_\\tau$. \n",
    "- $a$: a matrix encoding the hyperprior over likelihood matrices $A$. The $j^{th}$ column of $a$, $a_{\\bullet, j}$, contains the $\\alpha$ vector to parameterize a Dirichlet distribution. In practice, each column of $a$ contains the parameters to sample the vector of probabilities of each observation given the state corresponding to the column.\n",
    "- $B$: Transition matrix between states which depends on the agent's action. It is indexed by an action, e.g. $B_{\\pi_i}$ (So really, it's a 3-d array, which at each action-index has an $m \\times m$ transition matrix). The $i^{th}$ column of $B_j$ contains the probabilities of transitioning to each possible state in the time step. So $B_{\\pi_{i-1}} s_{\\tau - 1}$ is the vector of probabilities of transitioning to each state at time $\\tau$, given the action indicated by the policy at time $i-1$, $\\pi_{i-1}$, and the state at time $s_{\\tau-1}$.\n",
    "- $D$: Parameters for categorical hyperprior over first state. \n",
    "- $C$: Parameters for categorical hyperprior over states or outcomes, depending on how you want to specify the agent's preferences. It encodes prior probabilities that effectly work like preferences for states or sensory input in the free energy framework.\n",
    "- $E$: Parameters for categorical hyperprior over policies\n",

This is done by gradient descent. Now that we have the free energy of a parameterization of Q consisting of the probabilities of all states for each timestep, the authors calculate the gradient wrt to each timestep, which is a vector for each timestep. The total gradient therefore (as it should) has the same shape as the parameters we are updating: a $T \\times n$ matrix.\n",
